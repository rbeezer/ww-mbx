# Introduction

# This is not a "true" makefile, since it does not
# operate on dependencies.  It is more of a shell
# script, sharing common configurations

######################
# System Prerequisites
######################

#   install         (system tool to make directories)
#   xsltproc        (xml/xsl text processor)
#   xmllint         (only to check source against DTD)
#   <helpers>       (PDF viewer, web browser, pager, Sage executable, etc)

# Use

#	A) Set default directory to be the location of this file
#	B) At command line:  make solutions  (and employ targets)

# The included file contains customized versions
# of locations of the principal components of this
# project and names of various helper executables

# These are source and custom XSL subdirectories
